Welcome to my GitHub!
My name is Hyemi, Kim and I am a Ph.D. candidate.
I am developing "The Automatic Simulation Tool Using Data-driven method in HVAC&R system."
Main method is 'Machine Learning Method: Deeply hidden layer of MLP(MultiLayer Perceptron Model)".


This tool has 3 sub-models and 1 total model. 
* 3 sub-model
  1) Flow rate model: Predict the flow rate of each piece of equipment, and it means required capacity for handling load
  2) Equipment model: Predict the equipment's parameter and then calculate the outlet temperature and capacity.
  3) Connection model: Predict the inlet temperature of next time
